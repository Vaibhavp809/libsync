# LibSync React Native App - Test Verification Guide

## üéØ Overview
This document provides a comprehensive testing guide for the updated LibSync React Native application with real backend API integration.

## ‚úÖ Updated Features Summary

### üîß Key Changes Made
1. **Removed all static/mock data** from BookListScreen, MyReservationsScreen, and LoanHistoryScreen
2. **Updated API endpoints** to match backend requirements exactly:
   - `GET /api/books` - Fetch all books
   - `GET /api/books/search?query=<term>` - Search books
   - `POST /api/reservations` with `{ studentId, bookId }` - Create reservation
   - `GET /api/reservations/:studentId` - Get student reservations
   - `PUT /api/reservations/:id/cancel` - Cancel reservation
   - `GET /api/loans/:studentId` - Get student loan history

3. **Enhanced Book Display** to show:
   - Title
   - Author
   - ISBN (with fallback to "N/A")
   - Category
   - Availability Status
   - Reserve Button (only when available)

4. **Token Handling** with multiple storage formats:
   - Stores tokens in both `token` and `auth_token` keys for compatibility
   - Axios interceptors automatically attach `Bearer ${token}` to all requests
   - Handles token expiration with automatic logout

## üîß Pre-Test Setup

### Backend Requirements
1. **Server Running**: Ensure Node.js + MongoDB backend is running on port 5000
2. **Database Seeded**: Database should have sample books, users, reservations, and loans
3. **API Endpoints**: All required endpoints should be functional:
   ```
   GET /api/books
   GET /api/books/search?query=<term>
   POST /api/reservations
   GET /api/reservations/:studentId
   PUT /api/reservations/:id/cancel
   GET /api/loans/:studentId
   POST /api/auth/login
   POST /api/auth/register
   ```

### App Configuration
1. **Server IP**: Update server IP in the app if not using localhost
2. **Network Access**: Ensure device/emulator can reach the backend server
3. **Dependencies**: All npm packages are installed and up to date

## üß™ Step-by-Step Testing Procedure

### Phase 1: Authentication
1. Launch the app
2. Register a new user or login with existing credentials
3. Verify user data is stored and token is persisted
4. Close and restart app - should remain logged in
5. Navigate through the app to test token attachment

### Phase 2: Book Search
1. Navigate to "Search Books" screen
2. Verify books load from backend API
3. Test search functionality with various terms
4. Try reserving an available book
5. Verify reservation success and book status update
6. Test error scenarios (no internet, server down)

### Phase 3: Reservations Management
1. Navigate to "My Reservations" screen
2. Verify reservations load from backend API
3. Check reservation details are displayed correctly
4. Test canceling a reservation
5. Verify status updates after cancellation
6. Test empty state (user with no reservations)

### Phase 4: Loan History
1. Navigate to "Loan History" screen
2. Verify loan history loads from backend API
3. Check timeline display and status indicators
4. Verify date calculations (overdue detection)
5. Test different loan statuses (issued, returned, overdue)
6. Test empty state (user with no loans)

### Phase 5: Error Handling
1. Test app behavior with server offline
2. Test with invalid/expired tokens
3. Test network connectivity issues
4. Verify error messages are user-friendly
5. Test retry functionality

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Authentication Issues
- **Token not persisting**: Check AsyncStorage permissions
- **API calls failing**: Verify token format and header setup
- **Login loops**: Clear AsyncStorage completely and restart

### API Connection Issues
- **Server unreachable**: Verify server IP and port configuration
- **CORS errors**: Ensure backend CORS is configured for mobile app
- **Timeout errors**: Check network connectivity and server response time

### Data Display Issues
- **Books not loading**: Check API response format matches expected structure
- **Search not working**: Verify search endpoint and query parameter format
- **Status not updating**: Check real-time data refresh after actions

3. Clear app data and restart if persistent issues occur
4. Check network connectivity between device and server
