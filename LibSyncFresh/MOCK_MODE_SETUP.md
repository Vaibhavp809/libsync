## Quick Setup for Demo/Testing

### Option 1: Automatic Mock Mode (Recommended)
The app automatically switches to mock mode when it can't connect to a real server. This is perfect for:
- Testing the app
- Demonstrating features
- Student learning environments

### Option 2: Manual Mock Mode Setup
If you want to force mock mode:

1. **In the app**, navigate to any screen that shows an API error
2. **Tap "Enable Demo Mode"** when the error dialog appears
3. **Or go to Settings** (if you have a settings screen in your navigation)

### Option 3: Developer Setup
To permanently enable mock mode during development:

1. Add this to your `App.js` or main component:
```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// Enable mock mode on app startup
useEffect(() => {
  AsyncStorage.setItem('api_mode', 'mock');
}, []);
```
