1. **Start the App**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   expo start
   ```

2. **Test Login**
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Verify token persistence after app restart

3. **Test Book Search**
   - Search for books by title, author, or ISBN
   - Test reservation functionality

4. **Test Reservations**
   - View active reservations
   - Test cancellation functionality

5. **Test Loan History**
   - View complete loan timeline
   - Check date formatting and status indicators

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Setup
- Backend server should run on `localhost:5000`
